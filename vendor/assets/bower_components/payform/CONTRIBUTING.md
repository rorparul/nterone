# How to Contribute

Yay, you're interested in helping this thing suck less.  Thank you!

## Project Layout

  - `src/`  - Coffeescript Source
  - `dist/` - Compiled and Minified
  - `test/` - Unit Tests

## Having a problem?

A **great** way to start a discussion about a potential issue is to
submit a pull request including a failing test case.  It's really hard to
misunderstand a problem presented this way.  This way it's clear what the
problem is before you spend your valuable time trying to fix it.

## Have an idea to make it better?

Again, guard your time and effort.  Make sure that you don't spend a lot
of time on an improvement without talking through it first.

## Getting to work

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Pull Requests

**Make sure to send pull requests to `develop`.**

Good Pull Requests include:

  - A clear explaination of the problem (or enhancement)
  - Clean commit history (squash where it makes sense)
  - Relevant Tests (either updated and/or new)
